I'm an English teacher. I give private lessons to the children, prepare them for the state exam and improve their performance at school. I also have experience working with adults and students. 

I'm able to interest my students, find a common language and integrate their interests into the learning process.I prefer the communicative method of teaching.

In 2019, while I was a student, I started working at the school. I prefer to get practical work skills, so I started working from the 3rd year of study.
Now, I am a student of the 5th and this year I decided to study IT science, which is new field for me.

Before I have enrolled in RS-school, I looked for some JAVA courses and studied free steps in Yandex practicum.

I’m interested in Web Development because this field provides wide possibilities for professional growth. 
Beyond that  there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.


I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.

public class Multiply
{
   public static Double multiply(Double a, Double b)
   {
       return a * b;
   }
}

Example B)

                int day = scanner.nextInt();
                System.out.println("Введите размер траты:");
                double expense = scanner.nextDouble();
                moneyBeforeSalary = moneyBeforeSalary - expense;
                expenses[day - 1] = expenses[day - 1] + expense;
                System.out.println("Значение сохранено! Ваш текущий баланс в рублях: " + moneyBeforeSalary);
                if (moneyBeforeSalary < 1000) {
                    System.out.println("На вашем счету осталось совсем немного. Стоит начать экономить!");
