I'm an English teacher. I give private lessons to the children, prepare them for the state exam and improve their performance at school. I also have experience working with adults and students. 

I'm able to interest my students, find a common language and integrate their interests into the learning process.I prefer the communicative method of teaching.

In 2019, while I was a student, I started to work in a school. I prefer to get practical work skills, so I started to work from the 3rd year of study in Uni.
Now, I am a student of the 5th and this year I decided to study IT science, which is new field for me.

I have enrolled in RS-school and looked for some JAVA courses and studied free steps in Yandex practicum. Which was painfull. 

I’m interested in Web Development because this field provides wide possibilities for professional growth. 
Beyond that  there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.


I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will help me on this new IT feild.

This code is part of a financial application, as part of a project at Yandex Practicum.
This code is part of the conditional operator branching, which allows you to choose one of the scenarios of the program behavior. It is possible to enter a value. The value is written to the "moneyBeforeSalary" variable and stored in the data array.

```

Example B)
else if (command == 3) {
                System.out.println("За какой день вы хотите ввести трату: 1-ПН, 2-ВТ, 3-СР, 4-ЧТ, 5-ПТ, 6-СБ, 7-ВС?");
                int day = scanner.nextInt();
                System.out.println("Введите размер траты:");
                double expense = scanner.nextDouble();
                moneyBeforeSalary = moneyBeforeSalary - expense;
                expenses[day - 1] = expenses[day - 1] + expense;
                System.out.println("Значение сохранено! Ваш текущий баланс в рублях: " + moneyBeforeSalary);
                if (moneyBeforeSalary < 1000) {
                    System.out.println("На вашем счету осталось совсем немного. Стоит начать экономить!");
